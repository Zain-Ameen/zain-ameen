Professional Summary

I stand at the intersection of modern web development and resilient cloud infrastructure. My career has been defined by a drive to not just build applications, but to architect the environments they live in. I focus on the entire lifecycle of a digital solution—from writing the initial frontend code to configuring the cloud resources that ensure it scales securely.

I describe myself as a serial learner because the technology stack is always shifting. Whether I am configuring Microsoft Azure resources, managing identity with Entra ID, or optimizing database performance for high-traffic portals, I enjoy being the bridge between development and operations. My goal is to create systems that are not only user-friendly but also robust, secure, and operationally efficient.

Operational Workflow

Here is how I approach the convergence of development and cloud operations:

Experience Highlights

Web Administrator & SEO Specialist | Altasciences & Canada Health Infoway

I have extensive experience managing corporate web properties where uptime and security are critical. At Canada Health Infoway, I managed the technical ecosystem of our digital presence. My role heavily involved Azure DevOps for project tracking and agile delivery, bridging the gap between project management and technical execution.

I championed the stability and accessibility of our platforms. This wasn't just about code; it was about ensuring the hosting environment was secure and the content structure was optimized for performance. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to streamline publishing workflows, ensuring our backend systems could support the rigorous demands of a national health organization.

Senior Webmaster | Achēv

At Achēv, I focused on the full stack of web operations. I architected responsive sites that required robust database management and server configuration. I was responsible for the technical health of the platforms, handling everything from DNS configurations and domain renewals to SQL database optimization.

I utilized data-driven insights to refine the architecture. By analyzing user behavior through tools like Hotjar and Google Analytics, I optimized the server-side delivery of content to ensure fast load times and a seamless user experience across devices.

Lecturer | The TIPS College of Commerce

Teaching Computer Science fundamentals gave me a deep appreciation for the logic behind cloud systems. Explaining concepts like Computer Networks and Database Structures to students reinforced my own understanding of how data moves through a system—knowledge that is essential when architecting cloud solutions today.
